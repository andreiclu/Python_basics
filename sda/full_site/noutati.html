        <h2 class="subtitlu">Oscars 2022: Five ways the Academy is trying to stay relevant</h2><br />
        <h3>The 94th Academy Awards take place this Sunday. But with last year's viewing figures at an all-time
            low,<br /> organisers are under pressure to make the ceremony relevant again, particularly to younger
            audiences.</h3><br />
        <div><p>There used to be a hundred reasons to sit down and watch the<b> Oscars</b>.
            In a pre-social media age, it provided a rare opportunity to glimpse the world's biggest film stars gathered
            in the same place; to see what they were wearing and to hear their speeches.
            Secondly, it was a place to catch clips of the year's most acclaimed films, long before <b>YouTube</b> made
            trailers available on demand.
            And thirdly, there quite frankly wasn't much else to do. The highest-rating <b>Oscars</b> aired at a time
            when linear television was dominant, and there weren't as many channels to watch.
        </p></div>
        <p>But in an era of TikTok, YouTube and streaming, the biggest showbiz night of the year has been losing viewers
            and, with them, its power.
            "The biggest challenge is getting people to watch," ceremony producer Will Packer told Little Gold Men.
            "What that means is there's got to be something different about the show this year that connects with people
            outside of Hollywood.<br /> You've got to connect with the casual movie fan."
            It is a delicate balance trying to keep the ratings high while simultaneously preserving everything that
            makes the Oscars sacred and prestigious. Here are five ways the Academy is hoping to capture audiences this
            year.<br />

        <h2 class="subtitlu">Megan Thee Stallion countersued by record label in album dispute</h2>
        <h3>Megan Thee Stallion's record label is countersuing the rapper, weeks after she filed a lawsuit against them.
        </h3><br />
        <p>It's over a row about what constitutes an album, with 1501 Certified Entertainment saying her Something For
            Thee
            Hotties record does not qualify.
            Megan has already claimed it does meet the conditions for an album.
            In a document seen by Radio 1 Newsbeat, 1501 wants an order in its favour and damages awarded for claims
            <b>Megan</b> has "repeatedly breached her contracts".
            The 2021 release debuted at number three on the US Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart in its first
            week of release.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the original case filed by Megan's lawyers, it says the record "clearly meets the definition" of an album            
            stating a length of 45 minutes or more is the only requirement in <b>Megan's</b> contract to define what an
            album is.
            But in its countersuit against Megan, 1501 say the record was not "original material" as it "included freestyles
            available on <b>YouTube</b> and archival material" - and only amounts to 29 minutes of new recordings
            featuring her.
            The label claims Megan's agreement dictates that "she must include at least 12 new master recordings of her
            studio performances of previously unreleased musical compositions" to get credit for an album under contract.
            <b>Megan has</b> responded on <b>Twitter</b> to the countersuit against her.
